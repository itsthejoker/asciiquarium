Asciiquarium is an aquarium/sea animation in ASCII art.

Installation
------------

Dependencies (Ubuntu):
    sudo apt install libcurses-perl
    sudo cpan install Term::Animation

Asciiquarium is a single perl script, so all you have to do is make sure
it's executable and put it somewhere convenient, like /usr/local/bin or
/usr/local/games.

Requirements
------------

You must have the Term::Animation module, which you can get from
http://www.cpan.org. The Term::Animation module also requires the Curses
module, which you can also get from CPAN. This program will only run on
platforms that have a Curses library (so it won't work on Windows, but
you might get it to run under cygwin).

Usage
-----

There are no command line arguments.
While running:
	q	quit
	r	redraw (will recreate all entities)
	p	toggle pause

Contributors
------------

Pretty much all of the ASCII art was done by Joan Stark:

Anything that she didn't do, I don't have a source for.
